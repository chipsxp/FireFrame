# Testing the User Profile Fix

## Steps to Fix and Test the Issue

### 1. Apply the Database Fix

1. Go to your Supabase dashboard
2. Navigate to the SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the contents of `fix-user-profile-error.sql`
4. Run the script
5. Verify that all queries complete successfully

### 2. Test the Fix

#### Option A: Test with a New User Signup

1. Clear your browser's local storage and cookies for your app
2. Try signing up with a new email address
3. Check the browser console for detailed error messages
4. The error should now show specific details instead of just `{}`

#### Option B: Test with Existing User

1. If you have an existing user that's experiencing the issue:
   - Sign out completely
   - Clear local storage
   - Sign back in
   - Check the console for detailed error messages

### 3. What the Fix Does

The updated code now provides:

1. **Better Error Logging**: Instead of logging `{}`, you'll now see detailed error information including:
   - `error.message`
   - `error.details`
   - `error.hint`
   - `error.code`
   - Full error object

2. **Fallback User Creation**: If fetching the user profile fails for any reason, the code will attempt to create a new user profile

3. **Graceful Error Handling**: If all else fails, the app will create a minimal user object to prevent crashes

4. **Database Schema Alignment**: The database script ensures all required columns exist with proper defaults

5. **Improved Trigger**: The database trigger now handles username conflicts and provides better error logging

### 4. Expected Console Output

After the fix, you should see console messages like:

```
üîç Fetching user profile for: [user-id]
üîÑ User not found in users table, attempting to create...
üìù Creating user profile for: { id: "...", email: "...", username: "..." }
‚úÖ User profile created successfully: [username]
```

Or if there are still issues, you'll see detailed error information instead of just `{}`.

### 5. Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue: "relation 'users' does not exist"
**Solution**: The users table wasn't created. Run the database fix script.

#### Issue: "duplicate key value violates unique constraint"
**Solution**: Username conflict. The trigger should handle this, but if not, the fallback creation will use a unique username.

#### Issue: "permission denied for table users"
**Solution**: RLS policies aren't set up correctly. The database script recreates them.

#### Issue: Still getting empty error objects
**Solution**: There might be a network connectivity issue or the Supabase client isn't properly configured.

### 6. Monitoring

After applying the fix, monitor your console logs during signup/signin processes. You should see much more detailed information about what's happening, which will help identify any remaining issues.

### 7. If Issues Persist

If you're still experiencing problems after applying this fix:

1. Check the Supabase dashboard for any error logs
2. Verify your Supabase URL and anon key are correct
3. Check that your database has the correct schema by running:
   ```sql
   SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable 
   FROM information_schema.columns 
   WHERE table_name = 'users' AND table_schema = 'public' 
   ORDER BY ordinal_position;
   ```
4. Verify the trigger exists:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM information_schema.triggers 
   WHERE trigger_name = 'on_auth_user_created';
   ```

The improved error logging should give you much better insight into what's actually failing.
