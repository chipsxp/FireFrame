# 🔧 Authentication Profile Fix Instructions

## Problem Summary

Users can sign up and authenticate successfully, but the app crashes when trying to fetch their profile because no corresponding record exists in the `public.users` table.

## Root Cause

- Supabase Auth creates users in `auth.users` table
- No automatic mechanism existed to create corresponding records in `public.users` table
- The `fetchUserProfile` function fails when querying an empty `users` table

## Solution Applied

### ✅ Code Changes Made

1. **Enhanced `fetchUserProfile` function** - Now handles missing user records gracefully
2. **Added `createUserProfile` function** - Automatically creates user profiles when missing
3. **Improved error handling** - Prevents app crashes with fallback user objects

### 🗄️ Database Setup Required

**IMPORTANT**: You need to run the SQL fix in your Supabase dashboard:

1. **Open Supabase Dashboard** → Your Project → SQL Editor
2. **Copy and paste** the contents of `database-auth-fix.sql`
3. **Click "Run"** to execute the SQL

This will:

- ✅ Ensure all required columns exist in `public.users` with proper defaults
- ✅ Create an automatic trigger to create user profiles on signup
- ✅ Create profiles for existing users (including your current user)
- ✅ Verify the setup worked correctly

### 🧪 Testing Steps

After running the SQL:

1. **Refresh your browser** to clear any cached errors
2. **Try logging in again** - should work without profile fetch errors
3. **Test signup flow** - new users should automatically get profiles
4. **Check browser console** - should see success messages instead of errors

### 🔍 Verification

Check your browser console for these success messages:

- `🔍 Fetching user profile for:` (for both new and existing users)
- `✅ User profile created successfully:` (for existing users)
- `🔄 User not found in users table, attempting to create...` (fallback working)
- No more `Error fetching user profile:` errors

### 📋 Next Steps

Once this fix is applied:

- ✅ Test the signup flow (should work perfectly now!)
- ✅ Test email verification
- ✅ Configure OAuth providers (when you get credentials)
- ✅ Remove debug logging (clean up console logs)
- ✅ Final testing of all authentication features

## Files Modified

- `FireFrameShare/src/hooks/use-auth.ts` - Enhanced profile fetching
- `FireFrameShare/database-auth-fix.sql` - Database trigger setup

## Support

If you encounter any issues:

1. Check the browser console for error messages
2. Verify the SQL ran successfully in Supabase
3. Check that the trigger and function were created properly
